DESCRIPTION: We'll add a start * next to the things you can already do well in react. We'll add an X to those that we're struggling with, and we won't add anything to those we haven't gotten to yet. We'll repeat the tutorial in the areas that we're struggling with, and we'll practice those areas over and over however long it takes until we truly get it an are able to consistently pass it with a star. We won't move on until we pass every single one of them.
